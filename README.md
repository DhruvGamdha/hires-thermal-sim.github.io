## Abstract

Accurate simulation of the printing process is essential for improving print quality, reducing waste, and optimizing the printing parameters of extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Traditional additive manufacturing simulations are very compute-intensive and are not scalable to simulate even moderately sized geometries. In this paper, we propose a general framework for creating a digital twin of the dynamic printing process by performing physics simulations with the intermediate print geometries.

## Key Features

- **High-resolution thermal simulation** of 3D printing processes
- **Voxel-based geometry representation** from G-code
- **Adaptive octree meshes** for efficient computation
- **Real-time predictions** faster than actual print time
- **Scalable to complex geometries** with sparse and dense infills
